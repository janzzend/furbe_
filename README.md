# FurBe — Dog Mood Detector 🐶📱

FurBe is a Flutter mobile app that detects a dog’s emotion in real time using an on-device TensorFlow Lite model. It classifies frames into **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, and **Scared**, aggregates decisions across multiple frames for stability, and logs results for later analysis.

> Built with **Flutter** (GetX, Camera) and an image classifier trained in **TensorFlow/Keras**, exported to **TFLite** and integrated via **tflite_flutter 0.11.0**.

## Features

- 🎥 **Real-time inference** from the device camera
- 🧠 **TFLite model** (EfficientNet/MobileNet backbone) — runs detection offline
- 🧮 **Bagged decisions**: averages softmax across **10 frames** before finalizing a mood
- ✅ **Confidence gating**: only save results with **≥ 60%** confidence (configurable)
- 📊 **Analysis view** with daily logs, calendar overview, and notes
- 📚 **Articles screen** linking to curated learning resources
- 👤 **Profiles** for dogs (name, gender, breed, birthdate, photo)
